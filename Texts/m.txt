When we’re interested in something, the frontalis muscles raise our eyebrows 
straight up, and our lip corners turn up in a slight smile, suggesting we’re 
feeling pleasure.

The expression of interest is related to the expression of happiness. But when 
we’re happy, we’ll show more exaggerated upward movements of our lip corners, 
and the muscles around the eyes will contract more, without the eyebrow raising 
straight up.

The tell-tale signs of genuine amusement are the open mouth and the backwards 
head movement. And like a genuine smile, you can tell a genuine laugh when you 
see the muscles contracting around the eyes, making crow’s feet.

Genuine laughter often relaxes all muscle movements in the body because of 
shifts in our respiration patterns that happen when we laugh. This rapid shift 
to a state of relaxation shuts off feelings of aggression or frustration—we’re 
cooperating with other people, not competing.

You see these muscle movements—in the lips, around the eyes, and in the 
brow—when people are feeling aggressive, threatened, or frustrated. Researchers 
think we make this expression when we’re angry because it could protect the 
face in a physical conflict—for example, the furrowed eyebrows could protect 
the eyes.

People often confuse anger and disgust, but disgust involves a raised upper lip
and a wrinkle in the nose that you don’t see here.

Sadness is characterized by oblique eyebrows, where the corrugator muscles pull
the eyebrows in, but the inner part of the frontalis muscle pulls them up. 
There’s also a little pouching in the inner part of the forehead, and people 
will often look down. Plus, the corners of the lips are pulled straight down, 
giving the mouth a curved look.

The expression of sadness is often confused with shame, and it shares the 
oblique eyebrow muscle movements of compassion.

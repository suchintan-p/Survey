When we feel disgust, the muscles above the upper lip pull up, raising the 
upper lip, wrinkling the nose, and narrowing the eyes.

People often confuse disgust and anger. But anger tightens the mouth and lowers
the eyebrows more significantly, and raises the upper eyelid. With disgust, the
mouth opens and the tongue comes out, just in case you need to throw up.

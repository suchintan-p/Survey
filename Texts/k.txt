When people feel sympathy or compassion, the corrugator muscles pull the 
eyebrows in and up, their lips press together, and their head tilts forward 
slightly—a sign of social engagement.

The expression of compassion is most often confused with sadness. The eyebrow 
movements are similar in sadness and compassion, but with compassion the lips 
press together; when we feel sad, our lips pull down.

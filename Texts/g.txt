Contempt is when you look down on somebody derisively or suspiciously. What’s
important about the expression of contempt is that the lips tighten on one side
of the face but not the other. If the tightening were on both sides of the face
, the person could be swallowing or salivating.

People often confuse contempt with disgust. But disgust involves the raising
of the upper lip, and the bridge of the nose wrinkles. We express disgust about
noxious things, not those about which we’re derisive or suspicious.

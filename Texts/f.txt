Surprise is often confused with fear. But when we’re afraid, our lower eyelids
tighten and our eyebrows look flat and tense; with surprise, our upper eyelids 
rise up and our eyebrows arch. Also, our jaws drop when we’re surprised, but
our lip corners go sideways when we’re afraid, making the mouth look tighter.

Some experts believe our eyes open wide like this because when we’re confronted
with something surprising—a long-lost friend, an unexpected award—we try to
absorb as much of this new information as possible.

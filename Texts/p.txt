Shame is a very simple display but a powerful one. It simply involves gaze 
aversion, with the head moving down so that the chin tucks into the neck. It’s 
the opposite of pride: Whereas with pride our head tilts back and our chin goes
up, shame often constricts our posture as a sign of submissiveness.

This expression is frequently confused with sadness. But shame doesn’t involve
the muscle movements of the sad face—the eyebrows pulled in and partly up, with
the lip corners moving down.

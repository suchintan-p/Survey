When we feel love, our facial expression often resembles happiness: The 
zygomatic major muscle pulls the lip corners up, and there’s a tightening of 
the lower eyelid.

But the distinct expression of love combines these muscle movements with a tilt 
of the head to the side. That’s a sign of intimacy and connection beyond just 
happiness.

When people are embarrassed, they avert their gaze, which means they move their
head down and to the side, exposing their neck. And the embarrassed smile is 
different from other smiles:The lips press together tightly, reflecting
feelings of restraint or inhibition.

Embarrassment can look like shame, but when we’re ashamed, our head moves
straight down, not to the side, and we don’t smile.

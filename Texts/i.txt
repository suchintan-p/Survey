This is a coy, flirtatious smile. What conveys flirtatiousness is when someone
turns his or her head away to signal ‘I’m not interested in you,’ but 
simultaneously makes eye contact. That’s a universal display that reflects the
ambivalence of flirtation—the flirter avoids and approaches someone at the same
time.
Someone flirting gives off signals of pleasure, as indicated by the zygomatic
major muscle pulling the lip corners up, which also raises the cheeks slightly.
Plus, the eyes are narrower than in a neutral state because the orbicularis
oculi muscles around the eyes contract, suggesting feelings of happiness.

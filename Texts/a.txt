We express fear when we feel physically or psychologically threatened.

The facial expression of fear is often confused with surprise.But when we’re 
surprised, our eyes open wider than when we’re afraid, and our mouth isn’t
pulled sideways, like it is here; instead, our jaw drops and the mouth hangs 
open. Plus, our eyebrows are relatively flat when we’re afraid; 
they arch more when we’re surprised.

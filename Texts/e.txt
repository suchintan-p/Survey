Pride involves signs of dominance. The corners of the lips rise slightly,
signaling that the person is happy. But what distinguishes this from happiness
is that the head tilts back, with a slight jaw-thrust. Those are classic signs
of power and dominance—they suggest that we’re feeling strong.

The expression of pride is also close to the expression of contempt.They both
involve a backward head tilt, but contempt doesn’t involve a slight smile like
pride does; instead, with contempt the lip movement is asymmetrical—only one 
side tightens.

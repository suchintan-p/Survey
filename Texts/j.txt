When we feel pain, our facial muscles move in ways that contract the face and 
protect us from harm. In the upper half of the face, the orbicularis oculi 
muscles around the eyes contract, closing the eyes tightly, and the corrugator
muscle lowers our eyebrows. In the lower half of the face,our lips tighten and
press upwards.
You'll see this particular expression especially when people are experiencing 
psychological pain, such as when they see other people suffer. It's an 
expression closely related to sadness. But rather than suffering in their own 
sadness, they experience the pain and suffering of others through empathy.

When we feel pain, our facial muscles contract the face and protect us from 
harm.

In the upper half of the face, the orbicularis oculi muscles around the eyes 
contract, closing the  eyes tightly, and the corrugator muscle lowers our
eyebrows. In the lower half of the face, our lips tighten and press upwards. 
Especially when experiencing physical pain, people will sometimes contract 
their neck, as is happening here, making this look even more like a display of 
self-defense.

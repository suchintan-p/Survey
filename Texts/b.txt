This is a classic display of a genuine smile, called a Duchenne smile, which 
signals happiness.

It’s defined by two muscle movements. The movement common to all smiles is the 
zygomatic major muscle pulling the lip corners up. But, critically, what 
reveals this as a genuine smile is what happens around the eyes:The muscles 
tighten, making those wrinkles, or crow’s feet, around the sides of the eyes 
and creating that pouching of the lower eyelid. When you see these signs, the 
person isn’t just smiling politely;he’s feeling genuine happiness.

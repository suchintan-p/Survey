Desire is signaled through the mouth, with lip bites, puckers, or (as in this
case) lip licks. The mouth is probably so strongly linked to desire because of 
the connection to kissing. People often make this facial expression when 
they’re interested in someone else sexually, but not necessarily romantically.

Desire is obviously a relative of love, but when people feel loving and 
trusting and devoted to someone else, as opposed to sexually aroused, they 
won’t necessarily make this kind of gesture with their mouth. Instead, they’ll
 often smile in a way that suggests happiness, with a head tilt to the side.
